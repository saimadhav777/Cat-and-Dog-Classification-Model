# Cat-and-Dog-Classification-Model
This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed to accurately classify images as either a dog or a cat. Trained on a diverse dataset, the model leverages deep learning. The architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract hierarchical features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
